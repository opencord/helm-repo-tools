      "message": "Hmmm on second thought we may need conditional logic in the patch.\n\nDevs are likely not be interested in peripheral changes (exact match on directories) but we will still need the ability to screen all charts for problems.  I believe this check was initially created to detect stale content that is in need of an update -- this is the only detection mechanism atm so targeted checking may create a coverage blind spot.\n\nrepo:onf-make contains lint/helm/, maybe we can cover the gap there with targets lint-helm-all and lint-helm-mod.",

      "message": "I have to admit that I am confused here. AFAICT the check is pretty clear that it tries to ensure that a chart version is updated whenever a file belonging to the chart (i.e., in the same chart directory) is changed. That functionality remains.\n\nThis change only prevents a false positive for the \"voltha\" chart for any change in _other_ sub-directories whose name also matches \"voltha*\" (i.e., changes in \"bbsim*\" directories never triggered a false positive on \"voltha\").\n\nI do not quite understand what the blind spot is, nor under which conditions the linting code should throw an error to warn about stale content.",

Distinct charts and versions could be grouped under a single version branded into the main voltha chart.",
